ALL of this code made was manually type-written by me. The only code that I can admit I didn't make was the mouse trail. I don't have much knowledge about how that was made and I will acknowledge my use of AI and youtube for that code.

Yes you can take INSPIRATION from this website, but do NOT copy my code. I had to go through so much learning, watching tutorials, and frustration (in summary, hell.) to make this website.
Why did I make this? 
Multiple choice!
1. I am a masochist (this is a joke)
2. I was bored <-- ✅
3. I love coding 
4. My life is a mess, I have no idea what I'm doing <-- ✅

HOW exactly did I make this? HOW does the JavaScript work, my brain hurts! Me too, don't worry :)
My main source was litr w3schools, life savior
oh, and youtube for tutorials (aka copying the code from the video XD)
JS: 
Mouse trail -- AI + YouTube
-- constants + if statements
-- not 2 sure tbh i copied a code from youtube and used ai to fix it 
Password function -- w3schools.com + YouTube 
-- uses arrays, i recommend you learn that before trying it out :>
-- if statements with several variables to get the about-me section to become visible
-- setTimeOut function to make the transitions work when they load up + CSS

Since the buttons are inside the about-me div i didn't need to include that in the if statement :)
just used document.getElementById then grabbed the button id then obv add an event listener (mouse click or simply tapping it w fingers on phone)
and variables
oki bye thanks 4 reading

u could literally easily make this in https://www.carrd.com so dont make ur life hard like how i did, this takes a lot of RANDOM motivation to make (unless u copy, which u shouldn't because i will break ur windows at night if u do)

made by sam
